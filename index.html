                <h5>System Engineer</h5>
                <small class="fg-theme">Infosys Limited, Banglore</small>
                <p>I began my professional journey at Infosys, where I was offered a position even before completing my academics. 
                  The supportive nature of my colleagues made my initial days at the company much easier. 
                  In Infosys, I worked on a data warehouse application, where raw data from different systems was collected, transformed, 
                  and cleaned to generate different types of reports as per the requests of Data and Business Analysts. 
                  
                  I worked on Microsoft Azure cloud, Linux servers, and Oracle database in a NDSD DevOps team of 9. 
                  where I played an instrumental role in creating, converting, and redesigning PL/SQL packages, Perl scripts, 
                  and data mappings for 13 projects to align with the modern networking infrastructure. 
                  I modified extract, load, and transfer job scripts for support activities, resulting in an optimization of job run time by 60%. 
                  Additionally, I suggested and instigated the automation of 3 PVT and 2 monitoring activities as a part of the Operational Excellence program.
                  My contributions to the Operational Excellence program helped to generate productivity and boost the team's ticket resolution rate by 40%. 
                  Our collaborative efforts also led to the attainment of 3 new projects, worth around 3 Million AUD. 
                  In addition to my technical responsibilities, I received training from experienced professionals on Java, SQL, networking, and REST API development. 
                  Through this experience, I gained a strong understanding of the importance of effective communication and collaboration in the business world.
                   I learned how to work effectively with clients and team members to deliver projects successfully, and developed my ability to think critically and make informed decisions.
                  
                  This was a valuable and fruitful journey at Infosys, where I learned time management while working in an agile team. 
                  Through interactions with clients in scrum calls and project requirement meetings, I developed strong listening and communication skills.
